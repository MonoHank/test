![Centrarium: A simple yet classy Jekyll theme.]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/images/centrarium/centrarium.png)

Over the last few months I've been working on a redesign of this website. Since it's built on Jekyll, adding a new theme on top of the existing content is easy. However, designing your own theme can be more of a challenge.

Taking inspiration from other [Jekyll themes][jekyllthemes] and utilizing styling tools like [Bourbon][bourbon], I built up a theme that fit my needs and aethetic preferences: minimalist design, easy to read, and mobile friendly. I also added some extra features, such as built-in social sharing, commenting (via [Disqus][disqus]), and archive pages, to flesh it out into a more complete blogging site. 

I dubbed the end result [Centrarium][demo], and you're looking at it right now!

Like many other Jekyll themes, Centrarium is open source. The project is [on GitHub][centrarium], so feel free to grab it and use it for your own site! Check out the [README](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium/blob/master/README.md) for a list of all the features, as well as installation instructions.

### Design Inspiration

I took a look at many existing Jekyll themes when designing Centrarium. Here are some themes that inspired me the most:

* [Mediator][mediator], the original theme I used for this site. I adapted many features from this theme: big headers (minus parallax), post listings, social sharing, and more.
* [Type Theme][typetheme]. Centrarium's header image concept was inspired by this theme.
* [Emerald][emerald]. I borrowed the pagination button styles from this theme.

Whether you're looking for a new theme or seeking inspiration for your own design, sites like [jekyllthemes.org][jekyllthemes] and [drjekyllthemes.github.io][drjekyll] are great for browsing all the open-source Jekyll themes out there.
