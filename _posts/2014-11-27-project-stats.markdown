![A college career summarized in a single bar chart.]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/projectstats.png)

[RIT][rit] is a career-oriented school, and the [New Media][newmedia] program is project-based. Between those things and the "learn by doing" attitude of [Computer Science House][csh], I did plenty of projects throughout my four years of college. Over 50 projects, actually - websites, games, and more - spanning over 20 different technologies.

For one of my final projects at RIT, I decided to visualize my college career. Using [Highcharts][highcharts], I created several charts and graphs detailing the number of projects done each term, the types of projects I've done, and the technoligies used in those projects.
