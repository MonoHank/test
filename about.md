Hello! I'm Ben Centra, a web developer from Cambridge, Massachusetts. I also dabble in homebrewing, music making, and indoor rock climbing.

I currently work at [Constant Contact][ctct] as a software engineer. After a year in the "Software Engineering Development Program" - rotating from team to team to learn new technologies and meet other developers - I landed on the Authoring team, which develops our next-generation campaign editor.

In 2014 I graduated from [Rochester Institute of Technology][rit] with a B.S. in New Media Interactive Development. I studied graphic design, animation (mostly 2D), game development, web development, mobile development, and more. I also received a Minor in Music & Technology, a combination of music theory, history, culture, and audio engineering.

Throughout college I was an active member of [Computer Science House][csh], a "Special Interest House" with a focus on, you guessed it, computers. I learned a ton while I was there, both through personal projects and just being in an atmosphere of learning and (more importantly) doing.
